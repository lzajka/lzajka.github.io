This is my first post on my website.
I&rsquo;ve bought this domain a few years back. It stayed empty because I had no idea what to put here.
Today, I decided to make it more interesting and finally add something. This is my first website, made using Hugo!
Why Hugo?
I&rsquo;ve tried making websites using NodeJS, Flutter, and other tools, but I&rsquo;m not the best when it comes to UI design.
Fortunately, I stumbled upon this tool called Hugo. All I need to do is write markdown files!">
