# Hello World!
This is my first post on my website.  
I've bought this domain a few years back. It stayed empty because I had no idea what to put here.  
Today, I decided to make it more interesting and finally add something. This is my first website, made using Hugo!

# Why Hugo?

I've tried making websites using NodeJS, Flutter, and other tools, but I'm not the best when it comes to UI design.  
Fortunately, I stumbled upon this tool called [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). All I need to do is write markdown files!

# Why are you bothering? No one is going to read this.

I know. I doubt anyone is even going to find this site, but if you're reading this, you've proven me wrong, so congratulations!

I'm more or less doing this for myself.
